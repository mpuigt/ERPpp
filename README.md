# ERPpp
This is a copy of the original ERPpp software created by Cyril Grandpierre. The website which hosted the software is now down but can be accessed through [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220122203630/https://www.erppp.com/) 

## What is ERPpp?

ERPpp means ERP for the small ones ("ERP pour les petits" in French) and was written by Cyril Grandpierre, a French engineer, inventor, captain of industry, and writer who died in 2023. His ERP software was intented to be used by start-ups and small companies which had not enough money (yet!) to afford a non-free solution. That's the reason why ERPpp is [open-source and free to use](https://web.archive.org/web/20220122203554/https://www.erppp.com/erppp/contrat-de-licence/). 

## What is provided?
ERPpp is using Microsoft Access. Two versions were provided by Cyril Grandpierre, i.e.,
* [A version with Access Runtime which can be used without Access license](/tree/main/ERPpp109-10b);
* ~~The sources to be run on any Windows computer with Access license (tested on Access 2007 and 2010)~~ Available here (hopefully) soon!

Moreover, a userguide (written in French) is also provided

## Note
These softwares and userguide are provided "as is" and are unfortunately not maintained anymore. If you update any of them, please contact me so that your updates will be shared with everyone in this git page.
